# C++ Terminal Utility Suite

## Introduction
The Terminal Utility Suite showcases the versatility of C++ in creating a powerful command-line interface using the nCurses library. This project features an interactive gaming module and utilities such as an Alarm Clock, Calculator, Converter, Newsreader, Weather App, Music Player, and more.

## Abstract
This project demonstrates the adaptability of C++ in crafting an enriched command-line environment. It integrates arrays, strings, functions, file handling, loops, nCurses, ASCII art, and various utility modules. Future improvements may include exploring the Qt framework for enhanced design and functionality.

## Key Concepts and Features
- **Arrays and Strings**: Efficient data management for utility modules.
- **Functions**: Modular design for scalability and maintenance.
- **File Handling**: Persistent storage with potential cloud integration.
- **Loops**: Iterative tasks for interactive gameplay and utilities.
- **nCurses Library**: Enhanced visual appeal for a seamless user experience.
- **ASCII Art**: Unique visual style for personalization.
- **Real-Time Information Display**: Current time, battery status, weather, and news.
- **Modular Design**: Facilitates scalability and maintainability.

## Utility Modules
1. **Alarm Clock**: Set alarms and receive notifications.
2. **Calculator**: Text-based calculator for quick computations.
3. **Converter**: Converts units, currencies, or specified values.
4. **Music Player**: Manage and play music from the command line.
5. **Payments App**: (Description needed)
6. **Simple Game Feature**: Classic, text-based game for fun and interactivity.
